# ActionRPG

Action-RPG demo developed from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 following the [**Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-the-ultimate-game-developer-course/) from Udemy.

It contains a single open-world level where you can explore, find and pick up different weapons, fight multiple enemies and collect treasure.

All art assets, animations and sounds in the project have been adquired from the following sources:
- The official Marketplace from Epic Games.
- Quixel Bridge.
- Mixamo.
- The archive provided by the online course.
